Remember in Season 1, Episode 4 of Euphoria, when Cassie has a truly, uh, orgasmic time on a carousel ride? The actress who plays her, Sydney Sweeney, has now found herself at another nighttime carnival â€” only this time, she's swapped Maddie for Halsey, and things are way more mysterious.

Sweeney and Halsey (a noted Euphoria superfan) star in the video for "Graveyard," the singer's contemplative new single that finds her on the bruised end of a toxic relationship. It opens on Halsey, or Ashley, in her colorful childhood bedroom, where hand-drawn pictures and Alanis Morisette posters line the walls. The girl she's sketching suddenly appears beside her, and they're transported to an abandoned carnival, where they blissfully dance and twirl around in each other's arms.
