The second season of “The Handmaid’s Tale” is expanding into new worlds and with that development comes new blood, in the form of actress Sydney Sweeney, Variety has learned exclusively.

Hulu tells Variety Sweeney will recur in the guest starring role of 15-year-old Eden when the series returns in the spring of 2018. Eden is described as “pious and obedient,” someone who represents the next wave of true believers in Gilead. While she has dreams of one day becoming a Commander’s wife, her blind faith in this new world order makes her both naïve and dangerous to those around her. Sweeney will make her first appearance in the fifth episode of the second season.
