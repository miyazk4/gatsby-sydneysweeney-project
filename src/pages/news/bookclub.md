As more than one billion people have been asked to self-isolate in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, word lovers are turning to social media and video conferencing to continue their book clubs.

In an effort to encourage fans to join in book discussions, "Euphoria" actress Sydney Sweeney is collaborating with Bustle to launch her own virtual book club.

For the first installment of "Sydney Sweet Reads," the 22-year-old actress will read and discuss the first three chapters of Amy Spalding's latest YA novel, "We Used to be Friends."
