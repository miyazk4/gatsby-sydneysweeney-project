Big Time Adolescence, directed by Jason Orley, presents a new type of coming of age movies. It's a realistic and empathetic narrative about the meaning of becoming an adult and leaving things behind.

Unlike other movies of the same genre, like The Perks of Being a Wallflower, this one stands out a lot more between the relationship of the two main protagonists.
